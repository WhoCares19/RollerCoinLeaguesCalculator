There are two primary ways you can automatically input the Network power datas:

1. Paste Network Data - Paste the values old and trusted way by selecting them and pasting in appropriate box.
2. Paste Network Screenshot - Take a screenshot of the Network Power and pasting it in the appropriate box.
3. You Can also manually paste the appropriate network power one by one if you wish to.

By default when the Calculator starts, Paste Network Data is shown.
